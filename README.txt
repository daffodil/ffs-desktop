FFS-Desktop

This is an attempt at creating a FlightGear launcher xplatform using Qt.

Ideas are:

Make it lightweight (I know with Qt).
* ability to make it dissapear to the "desktop status"
* Embedded browser
* dynamic selection of MpServers
* Downladable aircraft straight from GIT

===== Help Wanted =====

I'm not by any stretch of the imagination a c++ coder,
more familiar with pyqt, python, php and javascript etc

Someone with c++ experience and qt would be useful, if even for code review etc.
